Hwang-Ung settled in what is now called North Korea, at the highest point on the peninsula. This was in the 25th reign of the Yao Emperor in China, approximately 2,333 BC.\nOne day a tiger and a bear appeared in front of Hwang-Ung and asked that they be made into human form. After great thought Hwang-Ung informed the animals that their wish could be granted, but it would be difficult and would take much patience. The animals agreed that they would do whatever it took to become human. Hwang-Ung gave the tiger and the bear twenty garlic cloves and some mugworts. They were told to eat these, stay in a cave and pray earnestly for 100 days.\nAfter twenty days the tiger became hungry and could no longer continue, so he left the cave in search of food. But when the 100 days were almost at an end, the bear began to lose its fur and its rear feet began to change, until at the end of the 100th day the bear had fully transformed into a beautiful woman. She became known as Ung-Yo, which means \"the girl incarnated from a bear\".\nHwang-Ung then married Ung-Yo, and she gave birth to a son, who they named Dan-Gun.

He was well known for his sincerity and lack of pretence in dealing with others. A farmer's son, he abandoned traditional learning in his home town, Pyongyang, and studied for two years at a missionary school operated by the Salvation Army. He became a Christian and felt he couldn't hate the Japanese as men. He decided to seek a source of national strength and cultivate it to regain national independence and prosperity.\nIn 1894, at the age of 18, Ahn became a member of the Tongnip Hyophoe \"Independence Association,\" which promoted independence from Japan and worked to reform domestic affairs and reduce dependence upon foreign countries.\nIn 1899, Ahn established the Cheomjin (\"gradual progress\") School in Pyongyang, the first modern and co-educational private school ever established by a Korean. The name of the school seemed to reflect his political philosophy of evolutionary social changes through education.\nAhn, Chang-Ho was one of the first Koreans to emigrate to the United States. He arrived in America in September 1902 with his newlywed wife, Lee Hae- Ryon, and, as the steamship approached Hawaii, Ahn resolved to stand tall above the sea of turmoil existing at that time in Korea, and decided to call himself \"Do-San\" (meaning \"Island Mountain\"). While living in San Francisco, he organised the San Francisco Social Meeting on September 23, 1903, and initiated a social reform movement that was desperately needed by the Korean American society. An accomplished orator and leader at the age of 24, Ahn guided his countrymen to form a respectable community for Koreans in the United States. He organised a society that became the Kungminhoe (Korean National Association), which inspired Korean immigrants to hope for national independence.\nIn 1906, following the Russo-Japanese war, Ahn learned of the Japanese \"Protectorate Treaty\" that had been enforced on Korea, which gave the Japanese the legal right to occupy the country, and returned home. He organised an underground independence group in Pyongahn-do called Shinmin-Hoe (New Peoples' Association), an organisation dedicated to promoting Korean independence through the cultivation of nationalism in education, business and culture.\nIn 1908 the Shinmin-Hoe founded the Tae-Song (\"large achievement\") School in Pyongyang. This school was designed to provide Koreans with an education based on national spirit. Ahn, Chang-Ho worked a ceramic kiln as a commercial enterprise to raise funds for the publication of books for young people. The political environment of the time, however, was not conducive to the founding of such a school; in fact the Japanese were in the process of eradicating education for Koreans, in order to ensure illiteracy and essentially create a class of slave workers.\nWith Yi Kap, Yang Ki-tak and Shin Chae-Ho, Ahn embarked on a lecture tour of Korea, warning of the national crisis being incurred by the Japanese and urging the people to unite and resist the Japanese. Ahn repeatedly told Japanese leaders that Japan would profit more with Korea as a friend rather than an enemy.\nBy 1910 the Shinmin-Hoe had around 300 members and represented a threat to the Japanese occupation. The Japanese were actively crushing these types of organizations, and the Shinmin-Hoe quickly became a target of their efforts. In December of 1910 the Japanese Governor General, Terauchi, was scheduled to attend the dedicating ceremony for the new railway bridge over the Amnok River. The Japanese used this situation to pretend to uncover a plot to assassinate Terauchi on the way to this ceremony. All of the Shinmin-Hoe leaders and 600 innocent Christians were arrested. Under severe torture, which led to the deaths of many, 105 Koreans were indicted and brought to trial. During the trial, the defendants were adamant about their innocence. The world community felt that the alleged plot was such an obvious fabrication that political pressure grew and most of the defendants had to be set free. (By 1913, only six of the original defendants had received prison sentences.)\nBy this time, the Japanese had become fairly successful at detecting and destroying underground resistance groups. However, they were not successful in quelling the desire for freedom and self-government among\nthe Korean people. The resistance groups moved further underground\nand guerrilla raids from the independence groups in Manchuria and Siberia increased.\nThe Japanese stepped up their assault on the Korean school system and other nationalistic movements. After the passage of an Education Act in 1911 the Japanese began to close all Korean schools.\nIn 1913, the Tae-Song School was forced to close, and, by 1914, virtually all Korean schools had been shut down and all Koreans were attending Japanese schools. In order to do so, they had to abandon using their Korean language and their Korean birth-names, and instead use the Japanese language and Japanese names. The Koreans had the same conditions imposed on them in order to purchase food from stores. They were taught that they were the under-class whose purpose was to serve their superior Japanese masters.\nThis all but completed the Japanese campaign of cultural genocide. Chances of any part of the Korean culture surviving rested in the hands of the few dedicated patriots working in exile outside of Korea.\nWhen Japanese Governor-General Hiro-Bumi Ito was assassinated by Ahn, Joong-Gun, Japan tightened its grip on Korean leaders. Ahn, Chang-Ho was forced to go into exile in Manchuria, then Siberia, Russia, Europe, and finally the United States. In 1912, Ahn was elected chairman of the Korean National People's Association, which had emerged as an organisation for Koreans living abroad, and played an active role in negotiations with the US government. Around this time he also established Hungsadan, a secret voluntary group of ardent patriots. These and other organisations pressured President Woodrow Wilson into speaking on behalf of Korean autonomy at the Paris peace talks, and, in 1918, a representative of the Korean exiles was indeed sent to these talks.\nIn 1919, when the Yi Dynasty was forcefully absorbed into the Japanese Empire, Ahn started underground activities that focused on regaining Korean independence. He returned to Shanghai in April 1919 along with Rhee Syngman and Kim Ku, where Rhee became acting premier of a provisional government. They drew up a Democratic Constitution that provided for a freely elected president and legislature. This document also established the freedom of the press, speech, religion, and assembly. An independent judiciary was established and the previous class system of nobility was abolished. After trying in vain to narrow the differences of opinion between the leaders in Shanghai, he resigned from the post after two years.\nFinally, on March 1 1919, the provisional government in Shanghai formally declared its independence from Japan, and called for massive general resistance from the people of Korea. During the ensuing resistance demonstrations the Japanese police opened fire on unarmed Korean crowds, killing thousands. Many thousands more were arrested and tortured. Even after this, Ahn, Chang-Ho continued to work on in the United States on behalf of his country of birth. He created a village in Manchuria for wandering Korean refugees, and in 1922 led a commission which compiled all historical materials relating to Korea, particularly concerning the Japanese occupation.\nIn 1932 Ahn, Chang-Ho was arrested by the Japanese following a bombing carried out by Yun, Pong-Gil (although Ahn himself was not involved in the incident) and he was placed in prison in Taejon. After briefly being released he was arrested again by the Japanese police and stayed in prison until 1938 when, in poor health, he was allowed to leave the prison on bail. He died in a hospital in Seoul on 10 March 1938."],7:["1007","40","wh","Won-Hyo","Weon-Hyo","1","6th Gup","Green Belt","28","Won-Hyo was the noted monk who introduced Buddhism to the Silla Dynasty in the year 686 A.D. ","i","Won-Hyo (617-686 AD) was the noted Buddhist monk who introduced Buddhism into the Silla Dynasty in 686 AD.\nLegend has it that Won-Hyo's mother, while pregnant with him, was passing by a sala tree when she suddenly felt birth pangs, and, without having time to reach her home, gave birth to him there and then. The sala tree is significant, as it is usually only found in legends of highly revered figures. The name given to him at birth was Sol Sedang. He derived the pen name Won-Hyo (meaning \"dawn\") from his nickname, \"Sedak\" (also meaning \"dawn\"). He assumed this pen name in later years, after he had become more accomplished as a Buddhist philosopher and poet.\nCivil war amongst the Koguryo, Silla and Paekche kingdoms marked the period of Won Hyo's birth and childhood, and indeed it was not until 677 that the Silla dynasty unified Korea. Legend asserts that Won-Hyo, as a young man, took part in these bloody civil wars and saw many of his friends slaughtered, and it was this that drove him to turn his back on violence and become a monk. Most sources agree that he became a monk at the age 20. One story says he remodelled his home as a temple which he named Ch'ogae-sa; another says he simply shaved his head and went into the mountains to live as a monk. It is not even clear under which teachers he studied Buddhism; some say it was Nangji on Yong-ch'wi Mountain, others say he was a disciple of priest Popchang at Hungnyun-sa. Yet another legend has it that he learned the Nirvana Sutra from Podok, a Koguryo priest exiled in Silla. Buddhism was not a popular religion in Silla at that time, though; although it had been introduced into the kingdom of Koguryo in 372 and Paekche in 384, the general population of Silla was reluctant to accept it.\nIn 650, when Won-Hyo was 33 years old, he set out for China in the company of his friend Uisang; both of them had been inspired to study under the famous Buddhist scholar Huan-Tchuang. Their journey was smooth, except near the Chinese border in Liaotung, Koguryo, when they were mistaken for spies by sentries and barely escaped being captured. One of the most famous stories in Korean Buddhism concerns Won-Hyo's enlightenment during this attempted journey to China:\n\"One evening as Won-Hyo was crossing the desert, he stopped at a small patch of green where there were a few trees and some water. He went to sleep. Toward midnight he awoke, very thirsty. It was pitch-dark. He groped along on all fours, searching for water. At last his hand touched a cup on the ground. He picked it up and drank. Ah, how delicious! Then he bowed deeply, in gratitude to Buddha for the gift of water.\nThe next morning Won-Hyo woke up and saw beside him what he had taken for a cup. It was a shattered skull, blood-caked and with shreds of flesh still stuck to the cheek-bones. Strange insects crawled or floated on the surface of the filthy rainwater inside it. Won-Hyo looked at the skull and felt a great wave of nausea. He opened his mouth. As soon as the vomit poured out, his mind opened and he understood. Last night, since he hadn't seen and hadn't thought, the water was delicious. This morning, seeing and thinking had made him vomit. Ah, he said to himself, thinking makes good and bad, life and death. And without thinking, there is no universe, no Buddha, no Dharma. All is one, and this one is empty.\nThere was no need now to find a master. Won-Hyo already understood life and death. What more was there to learn? So he turned and started back across the desert to Korea.\"\nHis friend, Uisang, continued on to China and learned the doctrines of the Chinese school Hua-yen and later established this in Korea - as the Hwa-om school - when he returned.\nFollowing his return, Won-Hyo undertook prodigious amounts of scholarly work, and his writing was not the only area in which he gained recognition. He was well-known both to the general population and to the members of the royal family and their court. He was often asked to conduct services, recite prayers, and give sermons at the royal court.\nIn 660 AD, King Muyo became so interested in Won-Hyo that he asked him to come and live in the royal palace of Yosok. A relationship with the royal princess Kwa developed, and marriage and the birth of their son Sol-Ch'ong soon followed. Shortly after his son was born, though, Won-Hyo left the palace to travel the country, and he became highly respected by the people of Korea. He hated the fact that different religions argued with each other over their different beliefs, so he created his own ideology in which the conflicts between various religions could be reconciled.\nIn 661 AD, he experienced a revelation in his Buddhist philosophy and developed the Chongto-Gyo (\"pure land\") sect. This sect did not require study of the Chinese Buddhist literature for salvation, requiring instead merely diligent prayer. This fundamental change in Buddhist philosophy made religion accessible to the lower classes, and as such it quickly became very popular among the entire population.\nIn 662 AD, Won-Hyo left the priesthood and devoted the rest of his life to travelling the country teaching his new sect to the common people. Won- Hyo's contributions to the culture and national awareness of Silla were instrumental in the unification of the three kingdoms of Korea.\nWon-Hyo died in the year 686 aged 70, nine years after the unification of the Korean peninsula under the Silla dynasty. His body was laid in state by his son, Sol-Ch'ong, at Punhwang-sa temple.\nIt is said that during his lifetime Won-Hyo authored some 240 works on Buddhism; of these, 20 works in 25 volumes still exist. One of the forms he chose to use was a special Silla poetic form, Hyang-Ga. These poems were mainly written by monks or members of the Hwa-Rang and concerned patriotism, Buddhism, and praise of the illustrious dead. Won-Hyo's poem \"Hwaorm-Ga\" is said to be among the most admired of these poems. During his lifetime Won-Hyo dominated the intellectual and religious arenas both inside and outside Korea, and made extensive commentaries on all the different schools of Buddhism that were competing for supremacy at that time. He set the shape and form of Silla Buddhism and was also the dominant figure in the Korean Buddhist tradition. Along with two other famous Korean Buddhists, Chinul and Sosan Taesa, Won-Hyo was one of the most influential thinkers Korea has ever produced.\nHis belief was that one could obtain salvation, or enter the \"Pure Land\", by simply praying. This fundamental change in Buddhist philosophy made religion accessible to the lower classes. It soon became very popular among the entire population. However, his most remarkable achievements were his efforts in relieving the poverty and suffering of ordinary people. In 662 AD, Won-Hyo left the priesthood and devoted the rest of his life to traveling the country teaching this new sect to the common people. Won-Hyo's contributions to the culture and national awareness of Silla were instrumental in the unification of the three kingdoms of Korea.\nWon-Hyo died in 686 AD and was laid in state by his son Sol-Chong in Punhwang-Sa temple. He had seen the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea in his own lifetime and had helped to bring about a brilliant culture in Korea through his efforts in Buddhist philosophy.

When he grew up he became a teacher and founded a school, called the Sam-Heung (\"three success\") School. The Japanese occupation of Korea would mean that his school, like all others in Korea at that time, would come under great hardships. Due to its location, it would also become caught up in a Japanese power play.\nKorea was dragged into conflict as a result of trouble erupting in China in 1900. In response to the Boxer rebellion, the colonial powers descended upon the Orient in force to protect their interests. Prompted by the movement of Russian army units into neighbouring Manchuria in 1902, England formed an Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and a Russo-French Alliance was subsequently established in 1903, quickly followed by a movement of French and Russian troops into northern Korea. The Japanese saw this action as a threat to their intention to claim Korea for the Japanese Empire and demanded the removal of all Russian troops from Korea. When Russia rejected this demand in 1904, Japan initiated a naval attack. Korea claimed neutrality, but was invaded by Japan nonetheless; in autumn 1905 Russia surrendered and Japan was firmly established in Korea. This invasion was not viewed as an act of aggression anywhere outside of Korea.\nLong-term occupation of Korea required the takeover of the Korean government. Hiro-Bumi Ito, one of Japan's leading elder statesmen of the time, masterminded a plan to complete the occupation and political takeover of Korea, and was named as the first Japanese Governor General of Korea in 1905. From Japan, Ito pressured the weak Korean government into signing the \"Protectorate Treaty\" on November 19, 1905, which gave the Japanese the legal right to occupy Korea. Ito arrived in Korea in March 1906 to take the reins of power and ordered all foreign delegations in Korea to withdraw, leaving Korea at the mercy of the Japanese. The new Japanese puppet government passed laws that allowed Korean land to be sold to Japanese, although land was just taken anyway.\nThe Korean people were incensed by this, and waves of anti-Japanese violence swept the country. A number of guerrilla groups were formed to attack the Japanese occupation forces, but they were crushed by the much larger Japanese army. Popular violent unrest continued to spread as many loyal Korean government officials committed suicide, and Korean signatories to the Protectorate Treaty were assassinated.\nIn the face of this oppression, Ahn, Joong-Gun went into self-imposed exile in Manchuria where he formed a small guerrilla movement. His force, of about 300 men, carried out raids across the Manchuria-Korea border in order to maintain pressure on the Japanese.\nIn June 1907, the Korean emperor, Ko-Jong, secretly sent an emissary to the Hague Peace Conference in order to expose the aggressive Japanese policy in Korea to the world. When Hiro-Bumi Ito found out about this, he forced Ko- Jong to abdicate the Korean throne. Following this, in July 1907 the Japanese officially took over the Government of Korea. This led to severe rioting throughout Korea, involving many Korean army units. The Japanese responded by disbanding the Korean army and police force. The Korean army retaliated by attacking the Japanese troops, but were quickly defeated.\nIn response to increased Japanese activity in the Kando region on the border with Manchuria, Ahn, Joong-Gun led his guerrillas on a raid there in June 1909. The raid was a success, resulting in many Japanese deaths. Despite such guerrilla activities being planned and executed from within China, the Japanese arrived at an agreement with the Chinese and signed a treaty with them on September 4 1909. This treaty granted the Japanese access to connect to the Southern Manchurian Railway, allowing them to exploit the rich mineral resources in Manchuria. In return, the Japanese gave China the territorial rights to Kando. This act of selling Korean territory to another country was the final straw for patriots like Ahn. He retreated to his headquarters in Vladivostok, Siberia, to plan the assassination of the man he saw as responsible - Hiro-Bumi Ito.\nIto had planned to meet with a Russian official called General Kokotseff in Harbin, Manchuria on October 26 1909, to calm Russian fears over Japan's intentions to annex Manchuria and invade China. When Ito's train arrived at Harbin train station at 9:00am on the day of the meeting, Ahn, Joong-Gun was waiting for him. Even though he knew that he would be tortured if he was captured by the Japanese, Ahn shot Ito as he stepped off the train. He was indeed captured by Japanese troops, and imprisoned at Port Arthur. Whilst in the Japanese prisons, he suffered five months of barbaric torture. Other prisoners told that despite this unbelievable treatment, his spirit never broke. At 10:00am on March 26, l9l0, Ahn, Joong-Gun was executed at Lui- Shung prison at the age of just 32.\nAhn, Joong-Gun's scarifice was one of many in this chaotic time of Korea's history. His attitude, and that of his compatriots, symbolised the loyalty and dedication that the Korean people felt towards their country's independence and freedom. Ahn's devotion to his country was captured in the calligraphy that he wrote in his cell in Lui-Shung prison prior to his execution, which said simply \"The Best Rivers and Mountains\". This can be interpreted to mean that he felt that his country was the most beautiful on earth.

The smallest of these kingdoms, Silla, was constantly being harassed and invaded by its two more powerful neighbours, and so in 576 Chin-Hung, the 24th king of the Silla dynasty, established the Hwa-Rang (meaning \"flower of youth\") warriors from groups of talented young noblemen who were exceedingly loyal to the throne, who could be extensively trained in all forms of warfare and then successfully go into battle to defend the kingdom.\nEach Hwa-Rang group consisted of hundreds of thousands of members chosen from the young sons of the nobility (some as young as 12) by popular election. The leaders of each group, including the most senior leader, were referred to as Kuk-Son. These Kuk-Son were similar to the legendary Knights of the Round Table of King Arthur's reign.\nTrainees learned the five cardinal principles of human relations (kindness, justice, courtesy, intelligence and faith), the three scholarships (royal tutor, instructor and teacher) and the six ways of service (holy minister, good minister, loyal minister, wise minister, virtuous minister and honest minister). After completing their training, which usually lasted around ten years, candidates were presented to the king for nomination as a Hwa-Rang or Kuk-Son.\nThe Hwa-Rang trained to improve their moral principles and military skills. To harden their bodies, they climbed rugged mountains and swam turbulent rivers in the coldest months. The youths were taught dance, literature, arts and sciences, and the arts of warfare, chariot driving, archery and hand-to- hand combat.\nThe hand-to-hand combat was based on the Um-Yang principles of Buddhist philosophy and included a blending of hard and soft, linear and circular techniques. The art of foot fighting known as Subak, practised by common people throughout the three kingdoms, was adopted and transformed by the Hwa-Rang. They intensified it and added hand techniques - it was said that the Hwa-Rang punches could penetrate the wooden chest armor of an enemy and kill him, and that their foot techniques were said to be executed at such speed that opponents frequently thought that the feet of Hwa-Rang warriors were swords. They called this new art Taek Kyon.\nThe Hwa-Rang code was established in the 3Oth year of king Chin-Hung's rule. Two noted Hwa-Rang warriors, Kwi-San and Chu-Hang, sought out the famous Buddhist warrior-monk Wong-Gwang Popsa and asked that he give them a set of commandments that men who could not embrace the secluded life of a Buddhist monk could follow. These commandments, based on Confucian and Buddhist principles, were divided into five rules (loyalty to the king and country, obedience to one's parents, sincerity, trust and brotherhood among friends, no retreat in battle and justice in the killing of living things) and nine virtues (humanity, justice, courtesy, wisdom, trust, goodness, virtue, loyalty and courage).\nThe Hwa-Rang were the first group of trained warriors ever to possess a spiritual attitude toward warfare. This spiritual warrior code was passed on to Japan in the late 6th century AD, and it was from these roots that the famous \"Bushido\" Samurai tradition was eventually born.\nThe zeal of the Hwa-Rang helped Silla to become the world's first Buddhist kingdom, and eventually led to the unification of the three kingdoms of Korea. The battles won by the Hwa-Rang brought about the unification, but history would not be served, however, if it were not acknowledged that this unification was only achieved by a series of very bloody conflicts in which a large percentage of the Korean population was killed.\nAfter the unification of Korea and the defeat of the invading Chinese Tang dynasty, the thoughts of the Korean people began to move away from conflict and on to more philosophical ideas. As warriors, the Hwa-Rang fell into decline by the end of the 7th century. Their refined knowledge of healing caused them to become known as a group specialising in Buddhist philosophy, healing and poetry, but no longer did they enjoy the exalted status of royal warriors."],14:["1014","90","cm","Choong-Moo","Chung-Mu","1","1st Gup","Red Belt Black Tip","30","Choong-Moo was the name given to the great Admiral Yi Sun-Sin of the Yi Dynasty. He was reputed to have invented the first armored battleship (geobukseon) in 1592, which is said to be the precursor of the present day submarine. The reason why this pattern ends with a left-hand attack is to symbolize his regrettable death, having no chance to show his unrestrained potentiality, checked by the forced reservation of his loyalty to the king.","i","Yi, Soon-Sin was born in Seoul on the 28th April 1545. After his father left his job as a government official, the family moved to Asan, Chungcheongdo province and the young Soon-Sin started his education. He at first chose to study the liberal arts, but later decided to take the military course. He passed the entrance examination at the age of 32 and was appointed as a lower officer of Hamgyeong-do province to begin his military service.\nAfter rising through the ranks, Yi was appointed as naval commander of the Left Division of Cheollado in 1591, when he was 47 years old. It was at this time that he came up with the idea of the armoured battleship \"Kobukson\", or \"turtle ship\", a galley ship decked over with iron plating to protect the soldiers and rowers. It was so named because the curvature of the iron plates covering the top decks resembled a turtle's shell. It had a large iron ram at its prow in the shape of a turtle's head with an open mouth, from which smoke, arrows and missiles were discharged. There was another such opening in the rear, and six more on either side, all for the same purpose. The armored shell was fitted with iron spikes and knives that were disguised with straw or grass and designed to impale unwanted boarders. It was truly revolutionary, the most highly-developed warship of its time, and it was to play a crucial part in the ensuing war against Japan.\nWhen the Japanese Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi came to power in 1590, his priority was the conquest of China, as he knew that a war with China would drain the financial resources of his rival fuedal lords of Japan and cement his hold on power. In 1592 he approached Korea and requested her aid in this conquest. When Korea refused, he ordered two of his generals, Kato Kiyomasa (the Buddhist commander) and Konishi Yukinaga (the Christian commander), to attack Korea. His plan was to sweep through the peninsula and on to conquer China.\nThanks to their larger army and superior technology (the Japanese had imported muskets from Europe and developed their own, whereas the Korean army was armed with swords, bows and arrows and spears), the Japanese troops reached Seoul in just 15 days and occupied the entire country by May 1592.\nIn early 1592, at the start of the conflict, Admiral Yi Soon-Sin, in charge of the Right Division of Chulla Province, made his headquarters in the port city of Yosu. It was in Yosu at this time that he constructed his famous Kobukson; the first one was launched and outfitted with cannons just two days before the first Japanese troops landed at Pusan, and in May 1592, Admiral Yi engaged the Japanese at Okpa. In his first battle, Yi led 80 ships against a Japanese naval force of 800 aiming to re-supply their northern bases from their port at Pusan. By the end of the day, Yi had set 26 Japanese ships on fire and forced the rest to flee. Giving chase, he sank many more, leaving the entire Japanese fleet scattered.\nSeveral major engagements followed in which Admiral Yi annihilated every Japanese squadron he encountered. Courageous and a tactical genius, he even seemed to be able to outguess the enemy. In one incident, Yi dreamed that a robed man called out to him \"The Japanese are coming\". Seeing this as a sign, he rose to assemble his ships, sailed out, and surprised a large enemy fleet. He burned 12 enemy ships and scattered the rest. In the course of the battle, he demonstrated his bravery by not showing pain when shot in the shoulder, revealing his injury only when the battle was over, when he bared his shoulder and ordered that the bullet be cut out.\nIn August 1592, 100,000 Japanese troop reinforcements headed around the Pyongyang peninsula and up the west coast. Admiral Yi confronted them at Kyon-Na-Rang, among the islands off the southern coast of Korea. Pretending at first to flee, Admiral Yi then turned and began to ram the Japanese ships with his sturdy Kobukson. His fleet copied his tactic and they sank 71 Japanese vessels. When a Japanese reinforcement fleet arrived, Admiral Yi's fleet sank 48 of them and forced many more to be beached as the Japanese sailors tried to escape on land. This engagement is considered to be one of history's greatest ever naval battles, and it utterly crushed Japan's ambitions of conquering China.\nIn a brilliant move, Admiral Yi then took the entire Korean Navy of 180 ships, small and large, into the Japanese home port at Pusan harbour. There he proceeded to attack the main Japanese naval force of more than 500 ships, that were still at anchor. Using fire boats and strategic manoeuvring, he sank over half of the Japanese vessels, but, receiving no land support, was eventually forced to withdraw. With this battle, Admiral Yi completed what some naval historians have called the most important series of naval engagements in the history of the world.\nAdmiral Yi, Soon-Sin's dominance over the sea was so complete that no Japanese supply ships could reach Korea, and the Japanese forces began to dwindle. The stalemate naval blockade forced Admiral Yi into many months of inactivity, during which he prepared for the future; he had his men make salt by evaporating seawater, and used it to pay local workers for building ships and barracks, and to trade for materials his navy needed. His energy and patriotism were so great that many men worked for nothing. Having heard not only of Yi's military feats, but his contributions to the navy as well, the king conferred upon him the admiralty of the surrounding three provinces.\nUnfortunately, a Japanese spy named Yosira managed to ingratiate himself to the Korean General Kim, Eung-Su, and convinced the General that the Japanese General Kato was due to attack Korea with a great fleet. He convinced General Kim to send Admiral Yi to lie in wait and sink the fleet, but Yi refused on the grounds that the area given by Yosira was studded with rocks and highly dangerous. Admiral Yi's refusal to follow orders was seized upon by his enemies at court, and they insisted on his arrest. As a result, in 1597 Admiral Yi, Soon-Sin was relieved of command, placed under arrest and taken to Seoul in chains, where he was beaten and tortured. It was only the fervour of his supporters in promoting his past record that prevented the king from having him executed. Spared the death penalty, Admiral Yi was demoted to the rank of common foot soldier. He responded to this humiliation as a most obedient subject, going quietly about his work as if his rank and orders were totally appropriate.\nWhen Hideyoshi learned from Yosira that Yi, Soon-Sin was out of the way, the Japanese attacked Korea again with 140,000 men in thousands of ships. Admiral Yi's replacement, Won Kyun, led the Korean navy to a humiliating defeat that almost resulted in its total destruction. Fearing for his country's security, the king hastily reinstated Yi, Soon-Sin as naval commander, and, in spite of his previous treatment, Yi immediately set out on foot for his former base at Hansan. There, with a force of just 12 ships, he repelled a Japanese fleet of 133 ships sailing through the Myongyang Strait at night by hiding, spread out, in the shadow of a mountain and firing constantly as they passed, convincing the Japanese that they were facing a vastly superior force. The next day more Japanese ships arrived, but Yi fearlessly sailed straight at them, sinking 30 and causing the remainder to flee in panic as they recognised the return of the fearless Admiral. Yi gave chase and destroyed the fleet, killing the Japanese Commander Madasi.\nKorea was relatively weak at that time and relied heavily upon troops supplied by her close ally China (who had helped to drive Japan back following their initial occupation in 1592), and, in 1598, the Chinese emperor sent Admiral Chil Lin to command Korea's western coast. Admiral Chil Lin was an extremely vain man and would take advice from no one. Knowing this to be a serious problem, Admiral Yi made every effort to win the trust of the Chinese admiral, and his political skills proved to be as effective as his military ones as he allowed Admiral Chil Lin to take credit for many of his own victories. He was willing to forgo the praise and let others reap the commendation in order to have the enemies of his country destroyed.\nYi, Soon-Sin was soon in charge of all strategy while Admiral Chil Lin took the credit. This arrangement made the Chinese seem successful, which so encouraged them that they gave Korea more of the aid she desperately needed. Admiral Chil Lin could not praise Admiral Yi enough, and repeatedly wrote to the Korean king So-Jon that \"the universe did not contain another man who could perform the feats that Yi, Soon-Sin apparently found easy\". Unfortunately Admiral Yi, Soon-Sin never lived to see the rewards of the heroic efforts and brilliant strategies of his that led, finally, to the Japanese withdrawal at the end of 1598. On November 19, 1598, Admiral Yi was shot by a stray bullet during the final battle of the war. Even as he lay wounded on deck, he commanded that his body be hidden by a shield so that his enemies could not see that he had fallen. To his oldest son, he whispered, \"Do not weep, do not announce my death. Beat the drum, blow the trumpet, wave the flag for advance. We are still fighting. Finish the enemy to the last one.\" He was 54 years old when he died.\nAlthough known primarily for his invention of the Kobukson, he also developed other military devices. One of his little-known inventions was a smoke generator in which sulphur and saltpetre were burned, emitting great clouds of smoke. This first recorded use of a smokescreen struck terror in the hearts of superstitious enemy sailors, and, more practically, it masked the movements of Admiral Yi's ships. Another of his inventions was a type of flamethrower, a small cannon with an arrow-shaped shell that housed an incendiary charge, that he used to set fire to enemy ships. Along with his inventions, the tactical manoeuvres that he pioneered, such as his use of the fishnet \"V\" formation and the use of two-salvo fire against ships, demonstrate Yi's brilliance as a naval tactician.\nAdmiral Yi, Soon-Sin was one of the greatest heroes in Korean history. He was posthumously awarded the honorary title of Choong-Moo (meaning \"Loyalty-Chivalry\") in 1643, and the Distinguished Military Service Medal of the Republic of Korea (the third highest) is named after this title. Numerous books praise his feats of glory and several statues and monuments commemorate his deeds. His name is held in such high esteem that when the Japanese fleet defeated the Russian navy in 1905, the Japanese admiral was quoted as saying \"You may wish to compare me with Lord Nelson, but do not compare me with Korea's Admiral Yi, Soon-Sin...he is too remarkable for anyone.\"\nChoong-Moo\u2019s portrait is on the 100 Won silver coins in Korea.\nThe name Choong-Moo, representing \"Loyalty-Chivalry,\" was awarded posthumously to Yi Sun-Sin in 1643.\nChoong Moo is also the name of Korean's 3rd highest military award, the \"Distinguished Military Service Medal of the People's Republic of Korea\"."],15:["1015","100","kg","Kwang-Gae","Gwang-Gae","1","1st Dan","Black Belt","39","Kwang-Gae is named after the famous Gwang-Gae To-Wang, the 19th King of the Goguryeo Dynasty, who regained all the lost territories including the greater part of Manchuria.

Only Paekche continued to resist Koguryo domination during this period, thereby preventing what would have been the first recognized unification of the Korean peninsula.

The Ming Dynasty in China had grown extremely powerful during the 14th century, however, and began to beat back the Mongol armies, so that by the 1350s Koryo had regained its independence, although China garrisoned a large number of troops in the north-east of Koryo, effectively occupying part of the country.\nGeneral Yi, Sung-Gae had grown in power and respect during the late 1370s and early 1380s, and many of Chong's contemporaries plotted to dethrone then-King U and replace him with General Yi.\nIn 1388, General Yi, Sung-Gae was ordered to use his armies to push the Ming armies out of the Korean peninsula. The general, however, was no fool. He realized the strength of the Ming forces when he came into contact with them at the Yalu River, and made a momentous decision that would alter the course of Korean history. Knowing of the support he enjoyed both from high- ranking government officials and the general populace, he decided to return to the capital, Kaesong, and secure control of the government instead of possibly destroying his army by attacking the Chinese.\nYi marched his army into the capital, defeated the forces loyal to the king (commanded by General Choi Yong) and removed the government, but did not ascend the throne right away.\nKing Gongyang and his family were sent into exile in 1392 (where they would later be secretly murdered), but Chong, Mong-Chu faithfully supported the king, leading the opposition to Yi\u2019s claim to the throne.\nChong was revered throughout Koryo, even by Yi himself, but he was seen to be an obstacle and as such had to be removed.

A major Paekche expedition to Kyushu, Japan, led to the creation of the Yamato Kingdom and the beginnings of a new cultural legacy.\nIn 655, Paekche and Koguryo joined forces to attack Silla, although they were eventually driven back when Silla received aid from Tang Dynasty China. In 660, when a huge united army of Silla and the Chinese invaded Paekche, General Ge-Baek organised 5,000 soldiers of the highest morale and courage to meet them in battle.

In addition he made straw sandals, which he sold at the market in Cheongju. He is thought to have lived in this manner for roughly three years.\nAfter this period Son, Byong-Hi became the student of Ch'oe, Si-Hyung, who was the 2nd Great Leader of Dong Hak, and entered a life of devoted study. In 1894 Ch'oe, Si-Hyung led the Gabo Dong Hak Revolution in protest at the corruption of the Korean Joseon government, and Son, Byong-Hi served as a commander. This revolution quickly grew into a resistance struggle against foreign invasion and occupation, in which Japan was the principal target. Ch'oe's forces met defeat in 1895, however, and the revolution was put down at the hands of Japan's superior modern weaponry. After living for some years as a fugitive Ch'oe, Si-Hyung was captured by\npursuing government troops in 1898 and executed, although he had foreseen that his time was marked, and on December 24, 1897 he had ordained Son, Byong-Hi as the 3rd Great Leader of Dong Hak.\nIn 1898, following the execution of Ch'oe, Si-Hyung, Son, Byong-Hi sought political asylum in Japan. After the Russo-Japan War in 1904, he returned to Korea and established the Chinbohoe (\"progressive society\"), a new cultural and reformist movement designed to reverse the declining fortunes of the nation and to create a new society. Through Dong Hak he conducted a nationwide movement that aimed at social improvement through the renovation of old customs and ways of life. Hundreds of thousands members of Dong Hak cut their long hair short and\ninitiated the wearing of simple, modest clothing. Non-violent demonstrations for social improvement organized by members of Dong Hak took place throughout 1904. This coordinated series of activities was known as the Kapjin reform movement.\nMembers of Dong Hak were severely persecuted by the Japanese government, and so, on December 1, 1905, Son decided to modernize the religion and usher in an era of openness and transparency in order to legitimize it in the eyes of the Japanese. As a result he officially changed the name of Dong Hak to Chondo Kyo (\"Heavenly Way\"). The following year, Chondo Kyo was established as a modern religious organisation. Its central headquarters were based in Seoul.\nOver the years of Japanese colonial rule since the annexation in 1910, Son, Byong-Hi, like all Koreans, longed for freedom and independence. As a result of these years of oppression, he helped to set up a systematic underground anti-Japanese movement throughout 1918 which saw uprecedented cooperation between Chondo Kyo, Christians and Buddhists as they united under a common cause. Son's Chondo Kyo gave financial support to the movement, and he insisted that the independence movement must be popular in nature and non-violent. A Declaration of Independence was prepared and 33 national leaders selected, 15 of which were members of Chondo Kyo. Son, Byong-Hi was the most prominent of these.\nThe climax came on March 1, 1919 when, during a period of public mourning for the recently deceased Emperor Ko-Jong, the Declaration of Independence was publicly proclaimed at Pagoda Park in Seoul. This spark ignited the public, who took to the streets and demonstrated, calling for Korean independence. This initiated a nationwide movement in which many people took part, regardless of locality and social status, but the Japanese immediately mobilised their police and army and brutally put down the demonstrations, despite their peaceful nature.

This means holding fast to an independent position, rejecting dependence on others, using one\u2019s own brains, believing in one\u2019s own strength, displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, and thus solving one\u2019s own problems for oneself on one\u2019s own responsibility under all circumstances.\u201d\nThe Juche philosophy carries a great deal of controversy with it due to its political purpose and application in North Korea by Kim, Il-Sung and subsequently Kim, Jong-Il, and full understanding of it would require extensive exploration of its many aspects."],21:["1031","230","un","U-Nam",null,null,"2nd Dan","Black Belt","42","U-Nam is the pseudonym of the first President of Korea, Dr. Syngman Rhee.

The 33 movements in the pattern stand for the 33 patriots who planned the movement.","x","One of the earliest displays of Korean nationalism under the Japanese occupation of Korea came in the form of the Sam-Il (meaning literally \u201cthree-one\u201d, referring to the first day of the third month) Movement, which occurred on the 1st of March 1919.\nThe inspiration for these actions came from the \u201cFourteen Points\u201d and the right of national \u201cself-determination of weak nations\u201d proclaimed by President Woodrow Wilson at the Paris peace talks earlier that year. After hearing news of the Wilson\u2019s talk and realizing its consequences, Korean students studying in Tokyo published a statement that demanded Korean independence. When this news reached the underground movement in Korea that had been secretly forming throughout 1918, composed of 33 Chondo Kyo, Buddhist and Christian leaders including Son, Byong-Hi (Eui- Am), it was decided that the time to act was nearing. Secret plans were drawn up and information disseminated by word of mouth throughout the towns and villages of Korea.\nIt was decided that the movement should be staged two days before the funeral of Emperor Ko-Jong. From a Korean point of view this funeral brought to an end not only the Lee Dynasty but also one of the last symbols of the Korean nation. With the death of their Emperor, Koreans realized that any possibility of an independently ruled nation was lost, and that Korea lay solely in the hands of the colonial Japanese. This situation provided the necessary momentum for the Korean independence movements to mobilize themselves.\nAt 2pm on the 1st of March, the 33 patriots who formed the core of the Sam- Il movement assembled at Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul to read the Declaration of Independence that they had drawn up, and the crowds that had assembled in the park to hear it formed into a procession. The leaders of the movement signed the document and sent a copy to the Japanese Governor General, with their compliments. They then telephoned the central police station to inform them of their actions. As such, the\nJapanese police fell upon the procession and it was soon crushed and the leaders of the movement arrested. It is said that the crowd was fired upon by the officers. According to reports issued by the Yon-Hap news agency, \"...more than 6,000 demonstrators were killed and about 15,000 wounded. Some 50,000 others were arrested by the Japanese police\". According to another report the crowd cheered the arrested men.\nCoinciding with these events, special delegates associated with the movement also read copies of the proclamation from appointed places throughout the country at 2pm on that same day, but the nationwide uprisings that resulted were also brutally put down by the Japanese police and army.\nAs international response to the incident was virtually non-existent, one of the most important teachings resulting from the Sam-Il Movement for the nationalists was that they essentially needed to rely solely on their own efforts. They could not expect assistance from other, foreign nations to fight a battle that was not their own.\nIt is said that the Sam-Il Movement was one of the most extraordinary examples of passive resistance to foreign domination that the world has ever seen."],24:["1023","310","ys","Yoo-Sin","Yu-Sin","1","3rd Dan","Black Belt","68","Yoo-Sin is named after General Kim Yoo-Sin, a commanding general during the Silla Dynasty. The 68 movements refer to the last two figures of 668 A.D., the year Korea was united. The ready posture signifies a sword drawn on the right rather than left side, symbolizing Yoo-Sin\u2019s mistake of following his King's orders to fight with foreign forces against his own nation.","ivv","Kim, Yoo-Sin was born in Gyeyang, Jincheon in 595 AD, became a Hwa-Rang warrior at just 15 and was an accomplished swordsman and a Kuk-Son (Hwa- Rang leader) by the time he was 18 years old. By the age of 34 he had been given total command of the Silla armed forces.\nYoo-Sin felt that Paekche, Koguryo and Silla should not be separate countries, but should instead be united because all the people had the same ethnic background. He is regarded as the driving force in the unification of the Korean peninsula, and is the most famous of all the generals in the unification wars of the Three Kingdoms, but his victories were tempered by his regret that they had to be at the expense of people he considered\nto be ethnically the same as him. His first military engagement is believed to have occurred around 629, and through it he quickly proved his capabilities as a warrior. Silla was in a constant struggle with its neighbour to the west, Paekche, over territory. There had been gains and losses on both sides, and the struggle lasted for many years. It was during this period that Kim rose through the ranks of the military, rising to the position of general and becoming a skilled field commander.\nMany stories exist about General Kim, Yoo Sin. It is told that once he was ordered to subdue a rebel army, but his troops refused to fight as they had seen a large shooting star fall from the sky and believed it to be a bad omen. To regain control, the General used a large kite to carry a ball of fire into the sky. The soldiers, seeing the \u201cstar\u201d return to heaven, rallied and defeated the rebels. It is also said that General Kim ingeniously used kites as a means of communication between his troops when split between islands and the mainland.\nAnother story tells that once, while Silla was allied with China against Paekche, an argument broke out between Yoo-Sin's commander and a Chinese general. As the argument escalated into a potentially bloody confrontation, Yoo-Sin's sword was said to have leaped from its scabbard into his hand. Because the sword of a warrior was believed to be his soul, this occurrence so frightened the Chinese general that he immediately apologized to the Silla officers. Incidents such as this kept the Chinese in awe of the Hwa-Rang, and meant that in later years, when asked by the Chinese emperor to attack Silla, the Chinese generals refused, claiming that although Silla was small, it could not be defeated.\nWhen Koguryo and Paekche attacked Silla in 655, Silla joined forces with Tang Dynasty China to battle the invaders. Although it is not clear when Kim first became a general, he was certainly commanding the Silla forces at this time. Eventually, with the help of the Silla navy and some 13,000 Tang forces, Kim attacked the Paekche capital, Puyo, in 660 in one of the most famous battles of the 7th century. The Paekche defenders were commanded by none other than General Ge-Baek, although the Paekche forces consisted of about 5,000 men and were no match for Kim's warriors, which numbered about ten times as many. Paekche, who had been experiencing internal political problems, crumbled. Kim's Silla forces and their Tang allies now moved on Koguryo from two directions, and in 661 they attacked the seemingly impregnable Koguryo Kingdom but were repelled. The attack had weakened Koguryo, though, and in 667 another offensive was launched which, in 668, destroyed Koguryo forever. Silla still had to subdue various pockets of resistance, but their efforts were then focused on ensuring that their Chinese allies did not overstay their welcome on the peninsula. After some difficult conflicts, Silla eventually forced out the Tang and united the peninsula under their rule.\nKim was rewarded handsomely for his efforts in these campaigns. He reportedly received a village of over 500 households, and in 669 was given some 142 separate horse farms, spread throughout the kingdom. He died four years later at the age of 78, leaving behind ten children.\nGeneral Kim, Yoo-Sin lived to the age of 78 and is considered to be one of Korea's most famous generals of all time. Following his death in 673, General Kim was posthumously awarded the honorary title of King Heungmu, and was buried at the foot of Mt. Songhwasan, near Kyongju on the southeast coast of Korea, in a tomb as splendid as that of kings."],25:["1024","320","cy","Choi-Yong","Choi-Yeong, Choe-Yeong","1","3rd Dan","Black Belt","46","Choi-Yeong is named after General Choi-Yeong, premier and commander in chief of the armed forces during the 14th century Goryeo Dynasty.

His beginnings were humble, and his lifestyle would best be described as spartan. He paid little heed to his own clothes and meals, and eschewed fine garments or other comforts even when he became famous and could easily have enjoyed them. He disliked men who desired expensive articles, and he viewed simplicity as a virtue. His motto, inherited from his father, was \u201cDo not be covetous of gold\u201d.\nSuch a man was well suited for military service, and Choi quickly gained the confidence of both his men and his king during numerous battles with Japanese pirates who began raiding the Korean coast around 1350.\nAt 36 years of age he became a national hero when he successfully put down a rebellion by Cho, Il-Shin after his insurgents had surrounded the palace and killed many officials and Cho had proclaimed himself king. Then, in 1355, an armed rebellion took place in the troubled Mongol Yuan Dynasty that occupied part of China. Choi Yong was sent to help the Mongols quash the rebellion, and his success in nearly thirty different battles won him even more fame and favour at home. Upon returning to Korea, he dutifully reported to King Kongmin the internal problems experienced by the dying Yuan Dynasty, which gave the king the idea that the time was right to reclaim some of the northern territories previously lost to the Mongols.\nChoi commanded his troops well and recovered many towns west of the Yalu River, to the great delight of his king.\nHe served briefly as the Mayor of Pyongyang, where his efforts at increasing crop production and mitigating famine won him even more attention as a national hero. Then, in 1363, he distinguished himself further when a powerful government official named Kim, Yon-An tried to take control of the government and Choi was forced to defeat a 10,000-man Mongol force that attacked Koryo in support of the rebellion. Meanwhile, following a dream that he thought predicted that a Buddhist monk would save his life, King Kongmin promoted a monk named Shin Ton to a lofty position within his court, and allowed him considerable influence. Shin Ton , though, was ruthless and corrupt, and Choi \u2013 who vigorously opposed corruption in the kingdom \u2013 found himself at odds with him. Shin Ton engineered false accusations of misconduct against Choi that resulted in a punishment of six years in exile, and brought him dangerously close to the death penalty. When Shin Ton died, though, Choi Yong was restored to his previous position and was immediately asked to prepare a fleet to fight the Japanese pirates and eliminate the remaining Mongol forces on Cheju Island.\nHe engaged the Mongols first, who fought tenaciously, but Choi's forces eventually freed the island. Then, in 1376, the Japanese pirates advanced into Koryo and captured the city of Kongju. Chong, Mong-Chu (Po-Eun) secured assistance from the Japanese Shogun to eliminate these pirates, but the Japanese were of little help and General Choi Yong and his subordinate Yi, Sung-Gae managed to rout and eventually defeat them and reclaim Kongju.\nThe Ming Dynasty in China had become powerful during the 14th Century, and had driven back the Mongols and occupied part of north-eastern Koryo. In 1388, General Yi, Sung-Gae was ordered to use his armies to push the Ming armies out of the Korean peninsula. Knowing of the support he enjoyed both from high-ranking government officials and the general populace, however, he decided to return to the capital, Kaesong, and secure control of the government instead of possibly destroying his army by attacking the Chinese. When Yi returned, the loyal Choi Yong put up a gallant fight at the palace but was overwhelmed. Records differ as to what happened next, although it seems likely that he was banished to Koyang and later beheaded. Choi Yong is remembered as a great general who was wholeheartedly devoted to the protection of his country.

Koguryo was an aggressive and warlike nation with wide territories. It had developed a horse-riding culture and placed great emphasis on its military. These circumstances led to the formation of the Koguryo \u201cSunbae\u201d, an organisation of strong warriors that served to protect and strengthen the state and its centralised authoritarian ruling system. Both Yon-Gae Somoon and his son Namsang were known to have been members of the Sunbae.\nIn 612, Sui China had attempted to invade Koguryo, and would have done so if it had not been for the efforts of the great General Ul-Ji Moon Dok. The Sui Dynasty in China was overthrown by the Tang Dynasty in 618, and the new regime held greedy expansionist ambitions. When Emperor Taizong took over the Tang throne in 627 he dispatched troops to northern Koguryo to dismantle Koguryo monuments at the sites of Sui Dynasty soldiers' mass graves.\nIn 642, General Yon-Gae Somoon seized power from King Jianwu, and over the next few years the Chinese attacks grew more and more successful so that by 645 they had conquered a number of fortresses and towns, including Liaodong, the main base on the frontline. Taizong was serious enough about his conquest to have had 500 ships built to support it. In 645, though, the Tang offensive reached the fortress at Ansi.\nAt the fortress the army and general population of Koguryo, led by Yon-Gae, made a great stand and fiercely confronted the invading Tang, managing to resist the concentrated attack for 60 days. They fought valiantly, injuring Emperor Taizong himself, and the combination of their valour and the inclement winter forced the Chinese to retreat.\nTaizong continued his campaign against Koguryo for two years, but was unable to deal the killer blow and, in 647, he withdrew. His death in 649 and the subsequent confusion in the Tang Dyasty allowed Yon-Gae to consolidate his forces and retake much of the territory conquered by the Tang.\nAfter the death of Yon-Gae Somoon in 654, bitter dissent gradually began to arise amongst the leading Koguryo generals. When Silla and Tang came to learn of this internal turmoil, they took advantage and attacked Koguryo.

The best that can be said is that he was born in the mid-6th century and died in the early 7th century, sometime after 618.\nHe was born and raised in the kingdom of Koguryo, in a turbulent era of Korean history. It was a powerful and warlike kingdom, constantly warring with its neighbours, Silla to the southeast and Paekche to the southwest. The balance of power was roughly equal between the three kingdoms, however, and it took the injection of an outside influence to tip the balance. This influence was supplied by the kingdoms\u2019 much larger western neighbor, China. In 589 China had been united under the Sui Dynasty, and this new dynasty, hungry for power, would be the deciding factor in the struggles between Paekche, Koguryo and Silla. This was the background for Ul-Ji Moon Dok as he grew up.\nHe was an educated man, and eventually became a Minister of Koguryo, with skills in both the political and military sciences. He was called upon to render service as a military leader, however, when the very existance of the kingdom became threatened by alliances between its rival neighbors.\nThe Sui Dynasty was suspicious of Koguryo and saw its aggressive ways as threatening, so in 612 Sui Emperor Yang Je decided to subdue this dangerous neighbour and prepared to attack. He mustered an army of over one million men and personally led them against Koguryo. They quickly overran Koguryo outposts, camped on the banks of the Liao River and prepared to bridge it. General Ul-Ji Moon Dok was called upon to assist in the defence of the nation, and so he prepared to meet the superior Sui forces with a strategy of false retreat, deception and attack.\nAfter the Sui forces crossed the Liao River, a small contingent was sent to attack the Koguryo city of Liaotung, but General Ul-Ji sent his forces to meet them there and drove them out. As the rainy season progressed, the Sui forces tried other probing attacks, but these were not really of any significance, as they were mainly biding their time until the rainy season passed.\nWhen the rains stopped, Yang Je moved his forces to the banks of the Yalu River in northwestern Korea and prepared for a major assault. General Ul-Ji visited the Chinese camp under the pretense of surrender in an attempt to discover any Sui weaknesses. Emperor Yang Je listened to General Ul-Ji and allowed him to leave the camp, but shortly after changed his mind and set out after him. But it was too late \u2013 the general had discovered what he needed to defeat the force. He had learned that the Sui forces were short of provisions and had overstretched their supply lines, and so he decided to pursue a strategy of gradual retreat, hoping to lure his enemy deeper and deeper into hostile territory. He drew the Sui on, fighting a kind of guerrilla warfare, picking when and where he fought and allowing the Sui forces to feel as though victory was close at hand, all the while luring them deeper into his trap.\nA Sui advance force of over 300,000 men was sent to take the city of Pyongyang. General Ul-Ji continued to lure them closer and closer to the city, but led them to a strategic point where he could strike. His forces attacked from all sides, driving the Sui troops back in utter confusion. His troops pursued the retreating army, slaughtering them almost at will, so that it is said that only 2,700 troops successfully made it back to the main body of forces. This was the great battle of Salsu, and it has come to be known as one of the most glorious military triumphs in Korea's history. Following this defeat, winter began to set in and the Sui forces, short on provisions, were forced to return home.\nThe Sui Dynasty was beginning to disintegrate and Yang Je decided that he urgently needed to expand his empire in order to regain power, but the two more desperate attacks on Koguryo by Yang Je following spring met with similar disaster, and eventually internal rebellion in China forced the Sui to give up its desires on Koguryo. By 618, the relatively short-lived Sui Dynasty was replaced by the Tang Dynasty. General Ul-Ji Moon Dok's strategy and leadership had saved Koguryo from the Chinese.\nProbably the most distinguished military leader of the Koguryo period and one of the most well-known generals in Korean history, General Ul-Ji Moon Dok's leadership and tactical acumen was the decisive factor in saving Koguryo from destruction at the hands of the invading Chinese. He faced forces of far superior numbers and not only turned them back but was able to pursue and destroy them with such vigor that they were not able nor inclined to return.

The monk soldiers helped repulse the Japanese pirates who overran most of the Korean peninsula in 1592.","x","Little is known of the early life of Choi, Hyong Ung, other than that he was born in 1520 and that he became a monk. As was common for monks in this time, he travelled from place to place, living in a succession of monasteries. Buddhist monks had been forced to keep a low profile since the end of the Koryo period, as General Yi, Sung-Gae had been forced to eject Buddhism from its state of total permeation of government, in order to gain the support of Neo-Confucian scholar-officials to consolidate his position against his Buddhist political opponents when he overthrew King Gongyang in 1392. This was the beginning of the suppression of Buddhism, which came into full flower during the succeeding Lee Dynasty.\nBefore ever having tested his hand as a military commander, So-San was a first-rate Seon (Korean Buddhism) master and the author of a number of important religious texts, the most important of which is probably his \u201cSeon gugam\u201d, a guide to Seon practice which is studied by Korean monks even today. Like most monks of the Lee Dynasty, So-San had been initially educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Dissatisfied, though, he wandered through the mountain monasteries. Later, after making a name for himself as a teacher, he was made arbiter of the Seon school by queen Munjeong, who was sympathetic towards Buddhism. He soon resigned from this responsibility, returning to the itinerant life, advancing his Seon studies and teaching at monasteries all around Korea.\nThe mountains where the monasteries were located were dangerous, and so the monks had to learn to defend themselves. So-San recognised that the development of armour made striking and kicking much less effective, but he also noticed that wherever the armour bends, so does the body. He saw that by manipulation of these joints one could defeat an armoured opponent on the battlefield. He also applied this same principle to the use of a rope or belt as a weapon, which he discovered can be wrapped around the body of your attacker, trapping weapons and, when necessary, breaking joints as it wraps. It was used by So-San and the soldiers he trained to immobilise, carry and even kill their opponents. Wrapped around the mouth and nose the rope would prevent the opponent from breathing, bringing about unconsciousness and allowing them to be taken as a prisoner. Many of these techniques were adopted and developed to give birth to the modern art of Hapkido.\nAt the beginning of the 1590s, Japanese Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi, after stabilising Japan during this era of warring nations, made preparations for a large scale invasion of Korea. Korea was unaware of the situation in Japan, however, and was unprepared for the Japanese aggression. In 1592, after rebuffing Japan\u2019s request for aid in conquering China, approximately 200,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Korea, and the Waeran (Japanese War) began. At the beginning of the invasion, King Sonjo fled the capital, leaving a weak, poorly-trained army to defend the country. In desperation he called on Master So-San to organise monks into guerilla units. Even at 73 years of age he managed to recruit and deploy some 5,000 of these warrior monks, who enjoyed some instrumental successes.\nAt first, the Korean armies suffered repeated defeats, and the Japanese marched north up to Pyongyang and the Hamgyong provinces. At sea, however, the Korean navy, under the command of Admiral Yi, Soon-Sin, enjoyed successive victories. Throughout the country, loyal volunteer armies formed and fought against the Japanese together with the warrior monks and the government armies of Korea.\nThe presence of So-San\u2019s monks' army, operating out of the Heungguksa temple deep in Mt. Yeongchwisan, was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders in 1593 and again in 1598.\nSo-San died in 1604 leaving behind some 1,000 disciples, 70 of whom were monks and nuns, and many of whom held a prominent role in the later transmission of Korean Buddhism. One of the most important reasons for the restoration of Buddhism to a position of minimal acceptance in Lee Dynasty Korea was the role of So-San\u2019s monks in repelling the Japanese invasion. So- San is also known for his efforts in the continuation of the project of the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice, and in his works strong influence can be seen from Won-Hyo. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Korean Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Seon trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples, all four of whom were lieutenants of his during the war with Japan."],30:["1029","510","sj","Se-Jong",null,"1","5th Dan","Black Belt","24","Se-Jong is named after the greatest Korean King, Se-Jong, who invented the Korean alphabet (han-geul) in 1443, and he was also a noted meteorologist.

He was instead interested from an early age in learning and spent most of his time reading books, although at the age of just 12 he found the time to marry Sim On, a young girl two years older than himself.\nPrince Chong-An ascended to the throne in 1400 and took the name Taejong. He watched his young son grow in wisdom as he continued his studies, and by the time Yi Do was 22 years old King Taejong decided to make him Crown Prince and successor to the throne over his older brother. Soon afterward, his father decided to abdicate in favour of his son. Many in the king's court (including Yi Do himself) protested that the young man was not yet ready to shoulder such responsibility, but the king insisted and so in 1418 Yi Do became king and took the name Se-Jong.\nKing Se-Jong believed that good government could only come when a king recognised and trained talented men and installed them into influential governmental positions to administrate the various branches of government. To this end he established the Chipyonjon (Jade Hall of Scholars), an amalgamation of the Hall of Art and the Hall of Literature that he made sure included an extensive library. King Se-Jong then chose twenty of his most able scholars and made them Masters of Learning, a position that freed them to devote themselves full time to advanced learning. He also set up a system that encouraged local governors throughout the country to report to the king any individuals who distinguished themselves. These individuals were then given the chance to become government officials, or other positions according to their talents.\nOne of King Se-Jong's goals \u2013 the one for which he is most famous \u2013 was to make his people more educated by making it easier for them to become literate. At that time the Koreans used the Chinese script to document their spoken language, but Chinese writing consisted of thousands of individual characters that takes significant effort to master. King Se-Jong recognised that this was a barrier to learning, and threw his efforts into developing a system of writing that was simple and effective, and by 1443 he had completed the Hangul alphabet. He was so concerned with its perfection that he kept it for another three years so that he could test and modify it until he was satisfied. There was much resistance to the language, when it was first unveiled, from scholars who thought it would, among other things, limit the scholarly study of the Chinese classics. The king insisted, however, and ordered many of his scholars to begin translating classic books and Buddhist scriptures into Hangul. This greatly increased the ability of the layperson to become educated. In addition, he ordered that books be written that would be of help to the common man, such as the Farmers\u2019 Handbook, which provided guidance on farming methods and techniques to increase production. He also ordered more technical books to be written, such as a complete medical dictionary, and an 85-volume pharmaceutical encyclopaedia that contained medical therapies, acupuncture techniques and herbal prescriptions to treat 959 different diseases.\nKing Se-Jong also had some impressive political achievements. It was during his reign he was able finally to subjugate the Japanese pirates who had been raiding the Korean coastline for so many years. He extended the territory of Korea as far north as the Yalu River, and, domestically, he tried to control corruption and raise the moral standards of the entire country.\nTowards the end of his life, King Se-Jong tragically (and somewhat ironically) became afflicted by a paralysis that prevented him from speaking more than a few words at a time. He later developed a cancer and died in 1450 at the age of 52, after nearly 30 years on the throne.\nHe is proudly remembered as a king who was concerned for his people and fully committed to their intellectual advancement. Today, the main thoroughfare running north to south in front of Kyongbok Palace in Seoul bears his name. In addition, two holidays are related to him: Hangul Day (9 October) and King Se-Jong Day (15 May)."],31:["1030","600","ti","Tong-Il",null,"1","6th Dan","Black Belt","56","Tong-Il denotes the resolution of the unification of Korea, which has been divided since 1945.

Following Japan's surrender at the end of World War II, Korea was liberated from the Japanese. As it was liberated by both Soviet and US forces, the responsibility for overseeing the rebuilding and rehabilitation of Korea was divided between the two sides, and the country was divided along the 38th parallel. The USSR occupied Korea north of this line, the USA occupied the south.\nUnder the auspices of the UN, a democratic government established the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in 1948, with its capital in Seoul. The Soviets established the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) with its capital in Pyongyang. The peninsula remains divided in this way to this day.\nKorea has not been truly free since Japan started to encroach in 1876, and has been divided since 1945, not just in terms of being two separate states - the ideologies and politics of the two countries are also vastly different.\nIt was the dream of General Choi, Hong Hi to see a unified Korea."],length:32})},
